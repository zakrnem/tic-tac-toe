A. Computer algorith:
    A.1. Get a random number between 1-9 (pcRandomPosition).
    A.2. Try to mark the grid in gameGridArray[pcRandomPosition-1].
        A.2.1. If that item isn't empty return to A.1.
        A.2.2. If the item is empty let the user play.


Two options for letting computer mark the DOM:
1. Unite the markGrid() & markGridArray() functions, so the result is archieved in only one function.

2. Add a node selector to the computerPlayer function to let it mark the DOM
